        <h1>Sports</h1>
        <p>Below are three of my favorite sports and why I enjoy them so much.</p>
        
        <p> The first sport I love is hockey. On the Home page, I gave a brief summary about how I got into hockey, how long I have played it, and where I am today. I grew up idolizing my older brother who played the sport since he was about 4 years old. My dad coached him, then me when I started to play. Hockey was the main connecting sport, or in general thing, that brought my family together. When my little brother was old enough, he began to play after me. Hockey has created some of my fondest memories, and the best friendships I could ask for. Hockey has brought me to 3 countries total, one overseas in Sweden. I have had countless road trips with my brothers, parents, and friends throughout the years. Hockey is still a vital part of my life, as I play it in college at Saint Anselm College, where I am proud to be a captain of the team and hopefully bring another championship back to the Hilltop. </p>

        <p> The second sport I want to talk about is golf. While I understand golf is one of the most boring sports out there to watch, I truly think it is the most difficult to master or just get really good at. I started playing in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic started because it was a way for me to get back outside in fresh air, yet stay in safe distance from other people. Golf was a way for me to get away from the craziness the world was going through and get back in the sun, on a nice golf course. It was a sense of peace and one of the reasons why I enjoy it so much. As much as it infuriates me with its difficulty, it is one of the most peaceful things to do out there. </p>

        <p> The last sport I want to talk about it one I have never played, yet love to watch every Monday, Thursday, and Sunday when it is in season. Yes, football. I never desired to play football, while hockey and lacorsse were the two sports I loved to play the most. As I got older, I enjoyed watching football more than I do hockey, just because of the different pace and way the game is played. I love sitting down on Sunday afternoons with my friends and family, good food, and just watching a few football games at a time. There is nothing like it. </p>

        <h1>About </h1>
        <p>My name is Tommy Schwartz, born and raised in Connecticut. I am currently a senior Communication major and Professional and Creative Writing minor at Saint Anselm College, class of '24. </p>
        <p>On this website, you will learn about my two favorite hobbies, reading and sports. Sports will cover my passion and devotion to hockey, as well as my love for golf and football. My Books tab will cover a couple of my favorite books and the impact they have had on my, and why I enjoy them so much. </p> 
        <p> I am a player for the varsity Men's Ice Hockey Team. I played three years of Junior hockey with the Connecitcut RoughRiders of the Eastern Hockey League. I grew up playing in CT and on Long Island, where I met some of my life long friends. I have traveled to Canada, Sweden, and all around the states to play the game I have loved since I was 2 years old. </p>

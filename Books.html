        <p>Here are a list of my 3 favorite books I have ever read in my life, and why I enjoy them so much.</p>
              
          <p> The first book is called The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. This book is a heavy read, as it has over 1,000 pages in length. While it took a long time to read, it had the most riveting storyline I have ever read. The tragedy of betrayl, to the transformation of the protaganist to get his ultimate revenge after so many years, is just fantastic. The Count of Monte Cristo is a classic and one I feel every individual should read at least once in their life time. </p>
